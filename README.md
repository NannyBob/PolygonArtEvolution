# PolygonArtEvolution
Originally made for a University coursework.

This Project contains an evolutionary algorithm that is designed to produce digital reproductions of images from semi-transparent polygons.
See it in action here:

This Project also contains a meta-evolutionary algorithm, whose purpose is to determine the optimal parameters of the original evolutionary algorithm.
More details of this meta algorithm are avaible in the report linked below.
